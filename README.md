# Delox
- Hello guys, how are you?
- Delox is one of the best tools that can compete with the tools that remove the root of any operating system.
- Delox is one of the most powerful tools that was created under the supervision of someone who is active in the cyber security area, and I put this tool on my GitHub with their permission.

# install wsl/wsl2
- instal in windows
- git clone https://github.com/onexploit/Delox
